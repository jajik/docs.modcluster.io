Are you here to read the mod_cluster documentation? Just head over to https://docs.modcluster.io/ right away.

If you're here to contribute, welcome to the mod_cluster documentation repository!

== Contributing

How can I contribute?

* Get familiar with https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc].
* Open https://docs.modcluster.io and locate section you want to contribute.
* Click 'Improve this page â€“ edit on GitHub.' at the top of each section.
* Once finished editing, click 'Propose changes' which will open a new pull request.
** Alternatively, if you prefer using an IDE, fork and clone the repository locally and head over to `docs/src/main/asciidoc/` directory. Commit and propose changes as you normally would.
* Pull request will be promptly reviewed by mod_cluster project maintainers, merged, and changes will be live almost instantly!

== Guidelines

* Documentation changes infrequently. To minimize the maintenance cost of multiple documentation versions, use wording similar to "Since version 1.3" to describe behavior changes across versions.
** Documentation pertaining to legacy versions prior to 1.3 can be dropped from the current version as it remains archived in the legacy docs section.
* Commit messages: you can describe changes you have done, or you could leave the default GitHub message which will just say "Update section.adoc".
* Use shorter lines to make rebasing and editing from the web slightly easier, ideally a single sentence per line.
* Documentation always resides in `main` branch of the upstream (`modcluster/docs.modcluster.io`) repository.

== Issues

Issues can be reported using GitHub Issues:

https://github.com/modcluster/docs.modcluster.io/issues

== Building

Building locally requires JDK 11 or newer installed.
The build uses Apache Maven and provides Maven wrapper for ease of use:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw verify
----

Resulting files are located in the `docs/target/generated-docs/` directory.

== How does it actually work?

. Changes are proposed in a pull request for the `docs.modcluster.io` repository.
. GitHub Actions run CI to verify changes do not break the docs build.
. Changes are accepted and merged by a mod_cluster maintainer to the `main` branch.
. GitHub Actions detect the changes and run a maven build, push the changes into `gh-pages` branch of the upstream repository.
. GitHub Pages picks up the changes and deploys the website.

NOTE: `CNAME` record is configured on the website pointing to GitHub servers.
