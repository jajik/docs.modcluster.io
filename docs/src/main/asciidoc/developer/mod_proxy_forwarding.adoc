=  Forwarding SSL environment when using http/https proxy:

The variables supported by the servlet interface are the following:

* `javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate`

* `javax.servlet.request.cipher_suite`

* `javax.servlet.request.ssl_session`

* `javax.servlet.request.key_size`

To get the client certificate or any SSL information from the browser you have
to use mod_header to add the SSL information to header. To do that add in
`httpd.conf` of Apache httpd the following:

[source]
----
RequestHeader set SSL_CLIENT_CERT "%s"
RequestHeader set SSL_CIPHER "%s"
RequestHeader set SSL_SESSION_ID "%s"
RequestHeader set SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE "%s"
----

Then you need a valve in Tomcat to extract the information from the request
Headers. See http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbossweb/sandbox/valves/[the
original code]. The valve has been integrated in Tomcat and in JBossWeb
(since 2007).

Once you have build the `valves.jar` copy it in `server/lib/` and edit
`server.xml` to add `<Valve className="SSLValve"/>` in the `<Engine/>` part
of the file.
