= Encrypting connection between httpd and TC

The only way to encrypt the data between Apache httpd and Tomcat is to use
mod_proxy with https.

In httpd.conf you need something like:

[source]
----
SSLProxyEngine On
SSLProxyVerify require
SSLProxyCACertificateFile conf/cacert.pem
SSLProxyMachineCertificateFile conf/proxy.pem
ProxyPass / https://127.0.0.1:8443/
ProxyPassReverse / https://127.0.0.1:8443/
----

NOTE: `conf/proxy.pem` should contain both key and certificate (and the
certificate must be trusted by Tomcat).

NOTE: `conf/cacert.pem` must contain the CA that signed the Tomcat
certificate.
