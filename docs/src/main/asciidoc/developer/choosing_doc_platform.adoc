= Choosing Documentation Platform for mod_cluster

== Motivation / Goals

* provide upstream project with reliable documentation

* enable easy community and internal contributions

* minimal management overhead

== Requirements

* up to date "real-time" documentation (no pushing, merging, rebuilding)

* reliable documentation hosting, high uptime

* changelog of changes

* vendor independent documentation

* ability to link document sections (use to direct people in community to
particular sections)

* maintain 1.1.x, 1.2.x, etc versions of the documentation (patch/cherry-pick
changes)

== Candidates

=== DocBook (XML) in Project Repository (current)

**+**

* easy to create other formats / generating PDFs

**-**

* stale documentation, needs manual rebuilding and publishing

* need to maintain private infrastructure to host and push to

* too complex for everyone (and chatty XML)

* no community contributions (made better with subversion to git migration)

=== GitHub Wiki

**+**

* out of box markdown

* easy to setup

* easy (actually too easy) to contibute

**-**

* anybody can edit, no review process!

* needs a github account to contribute

* slight dependency on github

* unable to reasonably structure documentation

=== GitHub Pages

**+**

* can contribute directly from github (no setup required at all!)

* review changes with pull request process

* little github depedency, repo could be moved elsewhere

**-**

* github pages don't support jekyll plugins
(https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages[see])
â€“ unable to automatically generate TOC besides using JavaScript. use travis CI
and/or awestruct to generate and push automatically?
(http://awestruct.org/auto-deploy-to-github-pages/[see])

* needs a github account to contribute

* need to use Jekyll to use markdown format

=== Confluence

**+**

* needs jboss.org community account

* WYSIWYG

* changes are immediately published

* comments

**-**

* vendor lock-in, documentation cannot be reasonably moved elsewhere

* unable to see whole documentation in single page (verify)

* comments can take more space than the actual content and cannot be deleted

* fixes to 1.1.x, 1.2.x, etc have to be done manually

* poor WYSIWYG

* jboss.org reliablity
