=== Notes on node in httpd internals

The Notes describe how the httpd internal tables are filled with the above node
description.

==== reslist parameters

|===
| Parameter | Description                                                                   | Default
| hmax      | size of the connection pool (hard max). Use ap_mpm_query(AP_MPMQ_MAX_THREADS) | 
| smax      | soft max inactive connection over that limit after ttl are closed             | hmax
| min       | min number of connections to have available. Use 0                            | 
| acquire   | time in milliseconds to wait for an available connection. Use 0 no wait return error | 
| ttl       | max time in seconds to life for connection above smax                         | 60
|===

Those are parameters to the apr_reslist_create() that handles the pool of
connections.

==== keepalive behavior

We force keepalive on.

=== Others

Other field of the proxy_worker structure will be filled with the default
values from mod_proxy.


=== proxy_worker_stat parameters

|===
| Parameter   | Updated by mod_proxy_cluster | Updated by mod_manager
| status      | yes                          | yes
| error_time  | yes                          | no

| lbset       | no                           | no
|===

status is filled by STATUS commands.

route is JVMRoute it is filled by CONFIG commands.

This information is in shared memory and the proxy_worker_stat uses a part of
this shared memory:

[source]
----
/* proxy_worker_stat structure: */
    int             status;
    apr_time_t      error_time; /* time of the last error */
    int             retries;    /* number of retries on this worker */
    int             lbstatus;   /* Current lbstatus */
    int             lbfactor;   /* dynamic lbfactor */
    apr_off_t       transferred;/* Number of bytes transferred to remote */
    apr_off_t       read;       /* Number of bytes read from remote */
    apr_size_t      elected;    /* Number of times the worker was elected */
    char            route[PROXY_WORKER_MAX_ROUTE_SIZ+1];
    char            redirect[PROXY_WORKER_MAX_ROUTE_SIZ+1];
    void            *context;   /* general purpose storage */
    apr_size_t      busy;       /* busyness factor *
    int             lbset;      /* load balancer cluster set */

== Notes on balancer in httpd internals

The Notes describe how the httpd internal tables are filled with the above
balancer description.

The information from the CONFIG message is packed in the shared memory:

StickySessionCookie and StickySessionPath are stored in sticky and separed by
a '|'

StickySession, StickySessionRemove and StickySessionForce are stored in
sticky_force

The StickySessionForce forces only to the domain (to node belonging to the same
domain) when the node corresponding to the sessionid belongs to a domain.

max_attempts_set: is set if Maxattemps is in the CONFIG message and its value
different from 1.

----
sticky sticky_force timeout max_attempts max_attempts_set
----

That is what is needed to create the balancer to be able to use it.

[source]
----
/* proxy_balancer structure extract: */
    const char *sticky;          /* sticky session identifier */
    int         sticky_force;    /* Disable failover for sticky sessions */
    apr_interval_time_t timeout; /* Timeout for waiting on free connection */
    int                 max_attempts; /* Number of attempts before failing */
    char                max_attempts_set;
