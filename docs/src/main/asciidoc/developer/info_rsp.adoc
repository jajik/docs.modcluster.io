= ModCluster INFO-RSP

== INFO-RSP

INFO-RSP is the response to a INFO command. Response would include information
on what virtual hosts are configured (so per-webapp commands can specify the
correct virtual host) and other info that ModClusterService can make available
to management tools (e.g. what addresses/ports httpd is listening on.)

The element are prefixed with their key id. The id of Context and Vhost are
node, virtualhost and the record number.

For example:

* Balancer[1]... The balancer corresponding to the nodes,

* Node: [1:1]... The first node in the node table.

* Vhost: [1:1:1]... An Alias of the Virtual Host belonging to the first node
and first Virtual Host.

* Context: [1:1:2]... A Context deployed/mapped in the first node and first
Virtual Host. That the 2 Context in the Context table.

The INFO-RSP can be display using the mod_cluster_manager handler note that in
this case the time values are in seconds except flushwait with is in
milliseconds.

=== Server (Not the actual version)

Server is corresponding to the server record in httpd that is a httpd
VirtualHost description. The following elements are dumped:

* Name: (String) Name of the server.

* Root: (String) Root directory.

* ThreadsPerChild: (Number) Number of thread per child process.

* MaxRequestsPerChild: (Number) Max requests a child will handle before
stopping.

* MaxClient: (Number) Max simultaneous requests supported.

* LimitReqFieldsize: (Number) max size of any request header field.

* LimitReqFields: (Number) max on number of request header fields.

* Scheme: (String) The server request scheme (http/https).

* KeepAlive: (Boolean) Server keeps connections opened between request.

* KeepAliveTimeout (Number) Amount of time the connection between httpd and the
browser is kept opened waiting for request.

* MaxKeepAliveRequests (Number) Max number of request for a browser httpd will
process before closing the connection.

* TimeOut (Number) Max time in seconds httpd will wait for a backend server.

=== Balancer

Balancer is corresponding to a balancer in mod_proxy logic. The following
elements are dumped:

* Name: (String) Name of the balancer.

* StickySession: (Boolean) Use JVMRoute to stick a session to a node.

* StickySessionCookie: (String) Name of the cookie containing the sessionid.

* StickySessionPath: (String) Name of the parameter containing the session when
it is URL encoded.

* StickySessionRemove: (Boolean) Remove sessionid if the node doesn't
correspond to the JVMRoute.

* StickySessionForce: (Boolean) Return error if no node correspond to the
JVMRoute.

* Timeout: (Number) Time to wait for an available worker. (seconds in
mod_cluster_manager)

* Maxattempts: (Number) number of attempts to send the request to the backend
server.

Example for mod_cluster_manager:

----
balancer: [1] Name: mycluster Sticky: 1 [JSESSIONID]/[jsessionid] remove: 0 force: 0 Timeout: 0 Maxtry: 1
----

=== Node

None is corresponding to a node of a cluster in AS (to a <Connector/> in the
server.xml). The following elements are dumped:

* Name: (String) That is the JvmRoute.

* Balancer: (String) The name of balancer that processes the loadbalancing for
the JvmRoute.

* Domain: (String) Use to group the node in buddy replicated nodes group.

* Host: (String) Hostname where the cluster node runs.

* Port: (Number) Port on which the connector is waiting for requests.

* Type: (String) Protocol using by the connector (AJP/http/https).

* Flushpackets: (String): Tell when buffer between httpd and browser should be
flushed.

* Flushwait: (Number): Time to wait before flushing (When flushpackets is
'Auto"). (milliseconds in mod_cluster_manager)

* Ping: (Number): Time to wait after a ping to receive a pong from a node.
(seconds in mod_cluster_manager)

* Smax: (Number): Max connections to keep opened between httpd and the back-end
server.

* Ttl: (Number): Max time a connection could exist when there is more than smax
connections opened. (seconds in mod_cluster_manager)

* Elected: (Number): Number of time the worker was chosen by the balancer
logic.

* Read: (Number): Number of bytes read from the back-end.

* Transferred: (Number): Number of bytes send to the back-end.

* Connected: (Number): Number of opened connections.

* Load: (Number) Load factor received via the STATUS messages.

Example from mod_cluster_manager:

----
node: [1:1],Balancer: mycluster,JVMRoute: neo3,Domain: [neuchdom],Host: 10.33.144.5,Port: 8009,Type: ajp,flushpackets: 0,flushwait: 10,ping: 10,smax: 11,ttl: 60,timeout: 0
----

=== Vhost

Vhost is corresponding to the hosts and Aliases defined in the server.xml.

* Alias: (String) Corresponding alias.

=== Context

Context is corresponding to the context deployed in the node.

* Context: (String) URL to be mapped.

* Status: (String) Status of the application: ENABLED, DISABLED or STOPPED.
